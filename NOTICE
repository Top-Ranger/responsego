ResponseGo! - A simple response system
   created by Marcus Soll (https://msoll.eu)

ResponseGo! is my personal response software.
It was developed with simplicity in mind - both in deployment and architecture.
As such, it might contain certain restrictions in terms of extensibility.
I developed the software with my specific needs in mind. It contains everything I need.
It might not fit your needs. That's ok.
But don't expect me to go out of my way implementing your requests.
I'm releasing the software in the hope that it might be helpful to others.

To run it, simply use the following commands:
go build
./responsego

To build the LDAP authenticater, you have to use the following build command:
go build -tags="ldap"

A sample configration can be found at 'config.json'.
To create a response link, simply browse to the future location of the response page.
No seperate creation is needed.
